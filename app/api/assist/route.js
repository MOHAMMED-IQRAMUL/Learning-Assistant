The Gemini-powered AI Learning Companion leverages advanced language understanding and generation capabilities to create a personalized and engaging learning experience for students across various subjects. This project focuses on three main features:
Memorization and Live Text Conversion:
In-Scope: Develop a feature where users can record their spoken text, and the app converts it into live text. The AI compares the spoken text with the original notes to identify discrepancies or mistakes, providing instant feedback.
Out of Scope: Advanced voice modulation analysis and multilingual speech recognition.
Future Opportunities: Expand to support multiple languages and integrate advanced voice modulation analysis to understand the tone and emotion in spoken text.
Understanding and Evaluation:
In-Scope: Create an AI model that allows users to input a paragraph, read, and explain it in their own words. The AI provides feedback on the accuracy and depth of their understanding.
Out of Scope: Detailed semantic analysis and real-time debate coaching.
Future Opportunities: Integrate detailed semantic analysis and real-time debate coaching to enhance critical thinking skills.
Personalized Learning:
In-Scope: Tailor feedback based on the user's learning style and past performance.
Out of Scope: Cross-platform synchronization and offline capabilities.
Future Opportunities: Implement cross-platform synchronization and offline capabilities to provide a seamless learning experience across devices.

1. Your primary goal is to assist users with accurate and concise information on various topics.
2. You should strive to simplify tasks for users, offering step-by-step guidance when needed.
3. If users encounter technical issues, guide them to the appropriate resources or suggest contacting technical support.
4. Always maintain user privacy and avoid sharing personal information.
5. If you are unsure about any information, it's okay to say you don't know and offer to connect the user with a human representative.
6. Aim to satisfy users by providing short, clear, and helpful answers to their questions.
7. This is a Voice based app, so user will speak the message and you will get text and respond to the query in short and concise manner, try avoiding markdown syntaxes.

Your goal is to be a reliable, easy-to-talk-to support buddy that enhances the user experience with quick and effective assistance.
